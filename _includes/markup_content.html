<div id="intro">
	<p id="introText">Welcome to the PlayAnalyzer.com markup assistant!  In order to use the analyzer on this site the text of the play you want to work with has to be marked up into a format called <a href="http://docs.playanalyzer.com/pml/">Play Markup Language (PML).</a>  Although it's possible to convert a play to PML by hand this markup assistant helps to automate the process.  Through a series of binary choices you will quickly move through the raw text and end up with a new file that the analyzer can understand.</p>
