<h1>Welcome to PlayAnalyzer.com!</h1>

<p>PlayAnalyzer.com is an open source project to provide automated tools for theatrical artists which provide insight into the structure and componistion of plays previously unavailable.  The tools aim to provide additional context about the latent structure of theatrical texts to improve the overall understanding and decision making ability at each stage in the artistic process.  It's not about replacing elements of the artistic process, but rather making artistic decisions more informed.</p>

<h2>Open beta</h2>
<p>Due to some of the technical complexity involved in the project, PlayAnalyzer.com is currently in open beta.  As a result, special permission must be requested to gain access to the bulk of the tools this site provides.  We hope that an automated account registration process will be set up soon, but for the time being please allow us a few business days to grant access to the artist tools portion of the site.</p>


<h2>Contributing to the project</h2>
<p>If you are technically inclined, PlayAnalyzer.com is built with <a href="http://jupyter.org/">jupyter notebooks</a> as the primary technical backbone.  We encourage you to contribute to our community's suite of tools on the project's public <a href="https://github.com/kevinmkarol/playAnalyzer">github.</a></p>
